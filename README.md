- 01_tables_r_python

The **{ggplot2} ðŸ“¦** is one of the most widely used packages for data visualization in R. It is based on **Grammar of Graphics**, Wilkinson (2012), and allows you to generate plots using layers. On the other hand, the **Grammar of Tables {gt}**ðŸ“¦ is used to generate tables with a structure similar to that of {ggplot2}, using layers. Both approaches can be combined with tables that include graphics. In this case, I put together an example with data provided by the open data portal of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The example is replicated with **{pandas}**ðŸ“¦.
